      <p>
        I am currently going into my senior year at Kentwood High School and
        going into my second year of my Associate's degree in software
        development and data analytics at Green River College. I plan on
        continuing my education and persue a bachelors in software development.
        If im blessed in the future I hope to get a job at microsoft or another
        company that would pay enough to support not just myself but the rest of
        my family too.
